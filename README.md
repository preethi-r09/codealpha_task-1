I have created a front end project "simple calculator" using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project is a basic implementation of a calculator that performs basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

Features:
   User-friendly interface built with HTML and CSS.
   Responsive layout for different screen sizes.
   Basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division).
   Clear button to reset the calculator.
   Real-time input validation for better user experience.

Technologies Used:
   HTML: Structure of the calculator.
   CSS: Styling the calculator and making it responsive. 
   JavaScript: Handling the logic behind the calculator operations.
