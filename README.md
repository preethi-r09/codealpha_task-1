I have created a front end project "simple calculator" using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project is a basic implementation of a calculator that performs basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

Features:
   1.User-friendly interface built with HTML and CSS.
   2.Responsive layout for different screen sizes.
   3.Basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division).
   4.Clear button to reset the calculator.
   5.Real-time input validation for better user experience.

Technologies Used:
   1.HTML: Structure of the calculator.
   2.CSS: Styling the calculator and making it responsive. 
   3.JavaScript: Handling the logic behind the calculator operations.
